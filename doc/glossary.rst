    ABI

        File format produced by ABI sequencing machines. Contains the trace data
        which includes probabilities of the four nucleotides. See SCF format
        here below.

    BAM

        Binary version of the Sequence Alignment Map (SAM) format.
        http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bam.html

    BED

        Format that defines the data lines displayed in an annotation track.
        (http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat#format1)

    BEDGRAPH

        TODO

    BAI

        The index file for a file generated in the BAM format. (This is a
        non-standard file type.)

    DSRC

        A compression tool dedicated to FastQ files

    FASTA

        FASTA-formatted sequence files contain either nucleic acid sequence
        (such as DNA) or protein sequence information. FASTA files store multiple
        sequences in a single file. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format

    FASTQ

        FASTQ-formatted sequence files are used to represent high-throughput
        sequencing data, where each read is described by a name, its sequence,
        and its qualities. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format

    GFA

        Graphical Fragment Assembly format. https://github.com/GFA-spec/GFA-spec

    GFF

        General Feature Format, used for describing genes and other features
        associated with DNA, RNA and Protein sequences.
        http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat#format3

    JSON

        A human-readable data serialization language commonly used in
        configuration files. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON

    PAF

        PAF is a text format describing the approximate mapping positions
        between two set of sequences.

    PHYLIP

        The PHYLIP file format stores a multiple sequence alignment.

    SAM
        Sequence Alignment Map is a generic nucleotide alignment format that
        describes the alignment of query sequences or sequencing reads to a reference
        sequence or assembly. http://samtools.sourceforge.net/

    SCF

        Standard Chromatogram Format (also known as trace file format, or ABI), a binary
        chromatogram format described in Staden package documentation SCF file format.

        configuration files. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML
