    ABI

        File format produced by ABI sequencing machines. Contains the trace data
        which includes probabilities of the four nucleotides. See
        the :ref:`format_abi` format page for details.

    ASQG

       The ASQG format describes an assembly graph. Each line is a tab-delimited
       record. The first field in each record describes the record type. See the
       :ref:`format_asqg` page for details.

    BAI

        The index file related to file generated in the BAM format. (This is a
        non-standard file type.) See the :ref:`format_bai` page for details.

    BAM

        Binary version of the Sequence Alignment Map (SAM) format. See the
        :ref:`format_bam` format page for details. 

    BCF

        Binary version of the Variant Call Format (VCF).
        See :ref:`format_bcf` page for details.

    BCL

        BCL is the raw format used by Illumina sequencers. See the :ref:`format_bcl` format 
        page for details.

    FASTA

        FASTA-formatted sequence files contain either nucleic acid sequence
        (such as DNA) or protein sequence information. FASTA files store multiple
        sequences in a single file. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format

    FASTQ

        FASTQ-formatted sequence files are used to represent high-throughput
        sequencing data, where each read is described by a name, its sequence,
        and its qualities. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format

    GFA

        Graphical Fragment Assembly format. https://github.com/GFA-spec/GFA-spec

    GFF2

        General Feature Format, used for describing genes and other features
        associated with DNA, RNA and Protein sequences.

    GFF3

        General Feature Format, used for describing genes and other features
        associated with DNA, RNA and Protein sequences.
        http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat#format3

    GENBANK

        GenBank Flat File Format.

        See :ref:`format_qual` page for details.

    SAM
        Sequence Alignment Map is a generic nucleotide alignment format that
        describes the alignment of query sequences or sequencing reads to a reference
        sequence or assembly. http://samtools.sourceforge.net/
