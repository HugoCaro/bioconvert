Converters not provided
=======================

Some converters will not be provided for now. Here is a list and the reason why
it is not provided.


bcl2fastq
---------

Illumina provides a bcl2fastq file and its user guide is available online.

In most cases, the BCL files are already converted and users will only get the
FastQ files so we will not provide such converter.

pdb2gmx
-------

This program reads a .pdb (or .gro) file, reads some database files, adds
hydrogens to the molecules and generates coordinates in GROMACS (GROMOS), or
optionally .pdb, format and a topology in GROMACS format. See http://manual.gromacs.org/archive/4.6.7/online/pdb2gmx.html for details. 

This tool is already quite complete and will not be provided for now.
