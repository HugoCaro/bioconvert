Converters not provided
==============================

Some converters will not be provided for now. Here is a list and the reason why
it is not provided.


pdb2gmx
-------------

This program reads a .pdb (or .gro) file, reads some database files, adds
hydrogens to the molecules and generates coordinates in GROMACS (GROMOS), or
optionally .pdb, format and a topology in GROMACS format. See http://manual.gromacs.org/archive/4.6.7/online/pdb2gmx.html for details. 

This tool is already quite complete and will not be provided for now.
